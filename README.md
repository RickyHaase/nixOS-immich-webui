# Easy Immich Server
A server management tool with a web UI designed to manage a NixOS system with the sole purpose of running and maintaining Immich on the host.

Currently un-developed. Building out templates, pages, docs, routes, and learning Go. Some resources will not be committed even if they're marked as "done" in the To-Do because while they've been created, they haven't been santized which will happen in an upcoming to-do
