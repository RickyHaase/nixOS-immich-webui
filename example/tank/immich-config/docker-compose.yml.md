This folder is representative of a folder/dataset that should exist on tank

I'm not sure if it will be populated by files from Immich or files embedded in the binary during setup

For now, these are the example files required to start up and run Immich. Instructions on what do to with these files can be found in the setup documentation

NOTE: current files are outdated and are what I had working back during the last time I worked on this project - I am just getting everything into the repo before I continue to make progress.
