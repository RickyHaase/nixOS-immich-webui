# Misc To-Dos
These to-dos either pre-date the roadmap or have yet to be added to it. This list serves as an intermediary between the considerations page and the roadmap in the README.
- [x] Split README into different pages in /docs/dev/ to keep things organized.
- [x] Although the work has been done, only a monolithic Nix config file has been committed to the repo as it was manageable in one template and one page in the UI (so far).
  - ~~Create a set of .nix files that define the desired state of the server, organized and compartmentalized logically.~~
    - ~~configuration.nix with only the imports and default timezone, language, and regional settings configured during install.~~
    - ~~system.nix with the systemd service for the web server.~~
    - ~~Additional .nix files as needed to hold the configs that will be modifiable via the web interface.~~
    - ~~admin.nix for an advanced admin to have a file that won't be touched, allowing them to modify with any additional configs they may want.~~
      - ~~This could be modifiable in an advanced option to enable/disable SSH without overwriting the entire file, just updating the relevant string.~~
- [x] Convert the .nix file into a template.
- [x] Build a web page that contains inputs to modify the necessary parts of the server config.
- [x] Structure the web server to read the existing config corresponding to each webpage on load, save the .tmp file on save, alert when leaving without applying, and copy to .nix and run a rebuild on reload.
- [ ] Implement auto-rollback if nixos-rebuild fails. Auto-rollback if no web requests are accepted by the server within 60 seconds of new config being applied. Provide an optional rollback to the previously applied config if the admin is unhappy with any resulting changes.
- [ ] Figure out how to embed templates into the binary.
- [ ] Parse templates at initialization instead of at runtime after core development of templates (thanks to YouTube comment @iskariotski).
- [ ] Add HTMX and CSS libraries into the source instead of calling from CDNs (eventually, no rush now).
- [ ] Test Podman as an alternative to Docker.
- [ ] Function to start/stop tailscale
- [ ] Function to sign out of tailscale
- [ ] Function to use tailscale serve for immich
- [ ] Caddy basic Auth
- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel integration - need docs on how to setup with OIDC and split connection in app
- [ ] Pangolin integration - basic w/ docs for self-hosted VPS
- [ ] Need to do something about email notifications and admin interface password reset
- [ ] Re-organize code into multiple files
- [ ] Create [Unit Tests](https://youtu.be/W4njY-VzkUU)
